                  <h4>Introduction</h4>
                  <p>Welcome to DeBros website. We operate as a decentralized platform where privacy is paramount. This Privacy Policy explains our commitment to your privacy and outlines that we do not collect, store, or process any personal information from our users.</p>

                  <h4>Use of Services</h4>
                  <p>Our decentralized nature means that all interactions occur directly between users without our mediation or storage of data. The site's functionality relies solely on the blockchain or peer-to-peer technologies where data management is handled by the network itself, not by us.</p>

                  <h4>Security</h4>
                  <p>Given that we do not collect or store any user data, there are no data security measures in place from our side. However, the blockchain or decentralized networks you interact with might have their own security protocols.</p>

                  <h4>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h4>
                  <p>DeBros may update this privacy policy from time to time. We encourage you to review this policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.</p>
